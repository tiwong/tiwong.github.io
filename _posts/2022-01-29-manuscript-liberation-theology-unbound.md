I've gotten tired of waiting to get the book published. And anyway, I had intended the text to be freely accessible from the beginning. So here is a full manuscript/draft of An Asian American Theology of Liberation. Please send me comments and feedback! UPDATE: [Here is the book](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/hd76s301r), open access! 

Also, for some background, see [this post](https://tiwong.github.io/theory/2019/03/21/to-the-archives.html).
