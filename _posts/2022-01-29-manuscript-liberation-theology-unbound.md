I've gotten tired of waiting to get the book published. And anyway, I had intended the text to be freely accessible from the beginning. So here is a full manuscript/draft of [An Asian American Theology of Liberation.](/files/Wong_AALT_2022_draft.pdf) Please send me comments and feedback!

Also, for some background, see [this post](https://tiwong.github.io/theory/2019/03/21/to-the-archives.html).
