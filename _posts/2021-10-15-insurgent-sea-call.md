![Call](/files/Call_ISEA.jpg "Call for Contributors: Insurgent Southeast Asia")

*Where will this be published?* At the moment, the Strategic Information and Research Development Centre (SIRD) at [Gerakbudaya](https://www.gerakbudaya.com/SIRD) has expressed interest in publishing the volume. There is also a possibility of co-publishing with another academic publisher, but all this is contingent upon having a strong manuscript. This is where *you* come in! 

*What are you looking for?* Anything that broadly fits the bill in the call above! If you're unsure or want to workshop an idea, write to me! At a basic level, I am hoping for:

Projected sections to include at least one contributor for each of the following countries: 
1.	Indonesia (e.g., protests against the omnibus law)
2.	Malaysia (e.g., protests against the Pakatan Nasional backdoor government; contract doctors strikes; and student protests against sexual harassment)
3.	Myanmar (e.g., the ongoing National Unity Government led revolution)
4.	Philippines (e.g., protests against the Duterte government; Chinese encroachment in the South China Sea; land struggles of the indigenous Lumad)
5.	Singapore (e.g., climate activists and independent journalists fighting against the continued suppression of dissent; vaccine nationalism)
6.	Thailand (e.g., protests against the monarchy in Thailand)
7.	Vietnam

Also, from a comparative aspect, potential transnational topics include:
<ol start="8">
<li>	Critical analysis of the Milk Tea Alliance from an anti-statist perspective
<li>	The colonial logics and logistics of palm oil industry in West Papua embedded in global financial networks, including Malaysia, Singapore, and USA
<li>	Police and prison abolition as a means of transnational organising/abolition outside a Eurocentric frame

*How strict are the deadlines?* They're not, so if you need additional time but want to be kept in consideration, again just write to me!
