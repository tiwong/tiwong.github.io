Projected sections to include at least one contributor for each of the following countries: 
1.	Indonesia (e.g., protests against the omnibus law)
2.	Malaysia (e.g., protests against the Pakatan Nasional backdoor government; contract doctors strikes; and student protests against sexual harassment)
3.	Myanmar (e.g., the ongoing National Unity Government led revolution)
4.	Philippines (e.g., protests against the Duterte government; Chinese encroachment in the South China Sea; land struggles of the indigenous Lumad)
5.	Singapore (e.g., climate activists and independent journalists fighting against the continued suppression of dissent; vaccine nationalism)
6.	Thailand (e.g., protests against the monarchy in Thailand)
7.	Vietnam

 Also, from a comparative aspect, potential transnational topics include
8.	Critical analysis of the Milk Tea Alliance from an anti-statist perspective
9.	The colonial logics and logistics of palm oil industry in West Papua embedded in global financial networks, including Malaysia, Singapore, and USA
10.	Police and prison abolition as a means of transnational organising/abolition outside a Eurocentric frame
