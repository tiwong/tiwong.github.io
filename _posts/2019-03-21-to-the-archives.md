Did you know Asian American liberation theology was a thing in the past? Well, it was. Alongside Black liberation theology, Latin American liberation theology, and white feminist liberation theology. What's left of it is hidden in dusty archives, most of it in the [Graduate Theological Union archives](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt75804087/entire_text/). I've managed to get some of them digitised. The second reader is done by myself, with thanks to the Vancouver School of Theology, and the rest are thanks to D. Stiver at the GTU, posted with permission of Roy I. Sano.
