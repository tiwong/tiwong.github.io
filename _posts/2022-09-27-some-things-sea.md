Besides working on moving [this volume](https://tiwong.github.io/theory/2021/10/15/insurgent-sea-call.html) along, here's some updates about what (else) I've been doing: 

- A [GETSEA minicourse](https://get-sea.org/past-courses/) on Anarchism and Southeast Asia! [See the syllabus](/files/Anarchism_Southeast_Asia_Syllabus.pdf).
- [This post](https://criticalasianstudies.org/commentary/2022/4/17/notes-from-the-field-wong-tian-an-should-southeast-asian-studies-exist-field-notes-from-an-interloper) in Critical Asian Studies on whether Southeast Asian Studies (in the West) should exist.
- And hopefully another minicourse next year on abolition!
